# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions for the 2021 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). Each puzzle day can
be found in its respective directory, and each directory contains two puzzles. As you can imagine, entering such a directory may
give you spoilers for the Advent of Code puzzles.

Please note that each input file in Advent of Code is generated per user. However, if the implementations are correct (which, of
course, they are `;-)`) any input file should be processed correctly.

The solutions are written in Golang. Enjoy!
